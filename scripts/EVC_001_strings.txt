Girl: "Do you know about the Snow Sakura?"
Snow Sakura?
DrawCharacter Misaki Shirt ANGRY 0
Girl: "Once a year, its flowers bloom in the chill of winter."
ClearCharacters
Even though it's a cherry tree?
Girl: "Yes, even though it's a cherry tree."
Cherry trees only bloom in the spring, you know.
Girl: "Normal cherry trees, yes. But this one blooms in the winter, so it's called the Snow Sakura."
That sounds like the name of some kind of cheap liquor.
Girl: "No way! You lack romanticism."
But there's no way such a cherry tree could exist.
Girl: "It does so exist! I saw it with my own eyes!"
Really?
Girl: "I'll show you! Over here!"
Hey, wait!
I don't even know your name yet...
Girl: "Oh, that's right."
Tell me your name.
Girl: "Okay. My name is..."
Girl: "My name is..."
Beep beep beep beep! Beep beep beep beep!
Yuuji: "Ugh..."
It was the familiar sound of my alarm clock.
I opened my eyes sleepily.

Yuuji: "........."
I don't recognize this ceiling.
I don't recognize this room, either.
For a moment I thought I was still dreaming.
I looked out the window to make sure.
There was snow as far as the eye could see.
It drifted lightly from above.
Yuuji: "It wasn't a dream..."
I slumped my shoulders dejectedly.
Just a few days ago, I was in Tokyo.
The warm air, the tall rows of buildings...
But...
Why am I now in this land of snow?
Yuuji: "I just don't get it..."
I buried myself under my blanket once again in hopes that this really would turn out to be a dream.
Rustle rustle!
Ahhh... This blanket is the greatest!
???: "What are you mumbling about? Come on, get up!"
Whoosh!
The blankets were pulled from my body.
Yuuji: "AAAHH!!"
It's incredibly cold!
Yuuji: "Saki...!!"
Saki: "Don't whine like that! You sound pathetic!"
Her name is Saki.
She's around my age, and I guess she would be considered my cousin.
She has a slim body and soft, silky hair.
She may look cute, but don't be fooled!
Saki: "Come on, get up and eat your breakfast."
Yuuji: "No way! I'm cold!"
Saki: "That's no excuse!"
Yuuji: "I don't want breakfast! I just want to sleep straight through to Saturday morning."
Saki: "Stop being such a lazy bum!"
WHACK!
Yuuji: "Oww!!"
She punched me right in the noggin.
Saki: "When you're in this house, you follow our rules!"
Yuuji: "What rules?"
Saki: "You must always eat your breakfast."
Saki: "If you don't eat your breakfast, you'll freeze to death!"
Yuuji: "You're lying!"
Saki: "I'm lying."
Yuuji: "Why, you..."
Saki: "Did you believe me, just a little bit?"
Yuuji: "No way!"
Saki: "This is why I hate smartasses who grew up in the city."
Smartasses!?
Will I be able to survive in this place?
I've got my doubts...
I wonder why this had to happen, anyway...
This isn't a dream, is it?
It sure seems like a dream.
I stared up at the ceiling.
Yuuji: "........."
I really don't recognize this ceiling at all.
The story began about a week ago...
A young man, namely me, was on his way home from school.
When I opened the door, I was in for a shock.
First of all, the furniture was gone.
The house was totally empty.
In addition, my mother and father were nowhere to be seen.
All that remained in the house was a note lying on the floor.
Naturally, in my confusion I read the note.
It said...
Keijiro: "To my stupid son..."
Keijiro: "I know this is sudden, but my business transfered me overseas."
Keijiro: "I'm going to Hawaii. We'll be here for a full year. Your mother is very happy."
Keijiro: "We were going to bring you with us, but you've been kind of a wiseass lately, so we decided to leave you behind."
Keijiro: "I've left everything else up to my brother in Hokkaido."
Keijiro: "Your school transfer has already been taken care of. Pack your bags and go to Hokkaido."
Keijiro: "P.S."
Keijiro: "Be strong!"
Saki: "So in other words, you were abandoned."
Yuuji: "Ugh..."
I guess you could put it that way.
Saki: "That's depressing all right."
Saki: "You probably had friends back at your old school."
Yuuji: "I don't care about that."
Saki: "Oh, what's this? You don't seem to be taking it very hard."
Yuuji: "I went to an all boys' school, you see."
I'm actually glad to get away from there.
Saki: "Well anyway, I guess there's nothing that can be done about that now."
Saki: "Dad is strangely happy about the whole thing too."
My father's older brother. In other words, my uncle.
He's taking care of me now.
He runs an inn here in the small rural town of Yukito.
Or rather, he DID run an inn.
Saki: "Speak of the devil..."
I looked up.
Uncle was standing before me.
Takeaki: "YUUJI!! ARE YOU AWAKE!?"
I could have sworn I heard some ribs break when he hugged me.
Yuuji: "Urgh!"
Takeaki: "I leave you alone overnight and you've gotten so big already! Why, you!!"
Yuuji: "Uncle... I can't breathe..."
Takeaki: "When was the last time we met? Ten hours ago? Eight?"
Yuuji: "Uncle... You're crushing me..."
Takeaki: "Yes, yes, I'm happy to see you, too."
"I'm not happy! I'm suffocating!"
Saki: "See? He's overjoyed!"
Yuuji: "Somebody stop him!!"
Saki: "Sure. Dad, Yuuji just woke up."
Takeaki: "Oh, I see! Time for breakfast then!"
Grasp!
Yuuji: "Gah!"
Uncle suddenly scooped me up into his arms.
What kind of beastly strength does he have!?
Takeaki: "Have a seat."
Yuuji: "Whew..."
I hesitantly sat on the floor.
Takeaki: "There's no need to hold back. This is just a shabby old shut-down inn. Let everything hang out!"
Saki: "You shouldn't talk about your own home like that!"
Saki sat down, grinning sarcastically.
Yuuji: "Oh? The inn is closed?"
I thought it was only temporarily closed for the winter months.
Saki: "I didn't tell you?"
I haven't heard a thing.
Takeaki: "We just weren't getting any customers, so I decided to close up shop last summer."
Saki: "The waitress who worked here quit as well."
Saki: "So now Dad and I live here all alone."
My aunt passed away ten years ago.
So I guess with me here, we're a family of three.
Riiiiing!
Takeaki: "Hm? Saki, could you get the phone, please?"
Saki: "Okay."
Saki left the room.
Takeaki: "So, what do you think?"
Yuuji: "Huh? About what?"
Takeaki: "About Saki! Don't you think she's grown?"
Takeaki: "You know, like an hourglass figure!"
Takeaki: "Hmm, well... Maybe not quite an hourglass."
Takeaki: "I don't know who she takes after, but her breasts sure haven't grown an inch!"
Bonk!
Takeaki: "Gurh!?"
Saki: "Don't be so rude!!"
Saki: "Anyway, the phone! It's for you!"
Takeaki: "Owww!!"
Uncle left the room, rubbing his head.
Saki: "Yuuji, when he does stuff like that, you should put him in some wrestling holds!"
Yuuji: "There's no way I could do that!"
Saki: "Oh, come on..."
Saki plopped down on the floor.
Now that you mention it, maybe she has grown up a bit.
Too bad her breasts haven't...
Saki: "Hm? Did you say something?"
Yuuji: "Nope, not a thing."
She'd kill me if I said that out loud.
Saki: "That phone call was from Sakuragaoka Academy."
Yuuji: "From school?"
Sakuragaoka Academy...
It's the school that I transfered to a mere five days ago.
Saki attends school there as well.
Yuuji: "That school is too far away."
Saki: "What are you talking about? It's only twenty kilometers or so!"
Yuuji: "Like I said..."
Saki: "There are trains here, you know! Though they only leave a few times a day..."
Yes, this town was about as far in the boondocks as you could get.
Yukito town, population 88.
It's actually more of a village than a town.
Step step step step...
Uncle came back.
Takeaki: "Yuuji, I know you just woke up, but..."
Takeaki: "I want you to go to school and deliver these papers."
Takeaki: "Along the way, you can pick up your uniform. Saki, go with him."
Saki: "Okay."
Yuuji: "Huh? But I haven't eaten breakfast yet!"
Saki: "You have three seconds."
Yuuji: "........."
I put on my thick down jacket and went outside.
Yuuji: "It's cold!"
Saki: "What are you talking about? It's cold because we're in Hokkaido. Quit complaining!"
We do live in Hokkaido, but... it's still really cold!!
It's so cold you could freeze a banana and use it to hammer nails!
Saki: "Well, let's go! Follow me."
Yuuji: "Yes, ma'am."
I followed Saki along the snowy path.
Rumble rumble... Rumble rumble...
It takes about an hour to get to school by train.
This train looks really old and shabby.
It runs on diesel fuel.
The floor is made of wood.
There's even an old gas heater inside the car.
It looks like I've stepped into some kind of alternate reality.
Will I be able to survive in this world?
I arrived at school.
The school building looks decent enough.
Its construction is rather old-fashioned, but it's got flavor.
Saki: "This is the faculty office."
Yuuji: "I know, I know!"
I know how to find my way around school by now, at least.
I walked through the school with Saki.
Yuuji: "Huh?"
Saki: "What's wrong?"
Yuuji: "These windows have two layers of glass."
Saki: "You just noticed that?"
Yuuji: "Yeah, just now."
Saki: "Most windows in Hokkaido are made like that."
Yuuji: "Why? Because it's cold?"
Saki: "Hmm... Well, I guess that's one reason."
Saki: "But it's actually because sometimes icicles fall down and break them."
Icicles...
This is a very strange world indeed.
Saki: "Come on, let's go!"
Yuuji: "Yeah..."
We entered the faculty office.
The smell of burning kerosene filled the air.
Saki: "Teacher, he's here."
.........
Saki: "Teacher! Miss Misato!"
???: "Y-yes!? I'm awake!! I'm not sleeping!!"
A surprised voice came from the far side of the room.
Saki: "He's here."
Misato: "Oh, yes, I see, I see, oh my..."
Thump! Crash!
There was a sudden crash, and the dull "thud" of a body hitting the ground.
Misato: "Owwwww..."
Saki: "Are you okay?"
Misato: "I'm okay! Owww..."
She's a klutz...
Misato: "I'm sorry for calling you all the way out here on a Sunday..."
She smiled.
She has a very kind smile.
She's quite beautiful.
This teacher is Misato Souya.
She's my home room teacher, and she teaches history.
Mental Note: She's a major ditz.
You might say she's a few cards short of a full deck.
Saki: "Here's the paperwork you wanted from Dad."
Misato: "Yes, this is it..."
Saki: "Teacher, you've got some drool on your chin."
Misato: "Huh? Oh, my!"
Wipe, wipe.
Misato: "Ah, hahaha. I must look like quite a mess."
Misato: "Let's see... Here's your new uniform. Please wear it starting tomorrow."
I took my uniform.
My hand brushed against hers.
It's so soft...
Yuuji: "Uh... Thank you very much."
Saki: "Why are you blushing?"
Yuuji: "Shut up!"
I went to an all boys' school before, so this is all new to me.
Misato: "Tachibana, please hold still for a moment..."
Suddenly, Miss Misato began to run her hands all over my body.
Yuuji: "W-what are you doing?"
Misato: "While you're here, I'm going to take your measurements for your gym clothes."
Grope, grope...
Misato: "Let's see, your inseam is..."
Her hand just barely touched my crotch.
Yuuji: "AAHHHHH!!"
Misato: "AHHH!?"
Saki: "Hey, you're not supposed to move!"
Yuuji: "B-but..."
Misato: "Now, please hold still."
Mmph...
Grope, grope...
Touch, touch...
It's kind of ticklish.
Saki: "You're not thinking anything dirty, are you?"
Yuuji: "I'm not!!"
Damn it...
Misato: "Okay, all done!"
She finally released me.
Misato: "Unlike your uniform, your gym clothes are ready-made, so they'll arrive soon."
Yuuji: "Thank you very much."
Misato: "No problem!"
She smiled.
Her smile is so innocent and childlike.
Saki: "Yuuji, it's time."
Yuuji: "Time? For what?"
Saki: "The next train. If we miss it, we'll be stuck here until nighttime."
Gah!
Why didn't you say so sooner?
Yuuji: "Excuse me."
Misato: "Okay! Be careful!"
I said my parting words and left the faculty office.
Saki: "Five minutes until the train leaves!"
Yuuji: "Five minutes!?"
Saki: "If we dash, we'll make it in time!"
Yoink!
She grabbed my arm.
Saki: "Run for it!"
Step step step step step...
Yuuji: "AAAAAHH!!"
Huff, puff, wheeze...
I'm exhausted!
Saki: "Oh, you sure look tired!"
Yuuji: "It's been a long time since I've had to run like that!"
Saki: "What kind of life have you lived before now?"
I can't believe it.
Saki: "Hey... What do you think?"
Yuuji: "About what?"
Saki: "Our school."
Yuuji: "Oh..."
I can't really say anything yet.
I like the school.
I really like the fact Saki and I are going to school together.
Though it is a little far away...
Saki: "Our school has a lot of cute girls."
Saki: "With me at the head of the list, of course!"
Yuuji: "It's snowing again today. It's all white outside."
Saki: "Wha!? He's ignoring me!?"
I've had enough of you for now...
By the time we returned to the inn, the sun was already beginning to set.
Whew...
I've had to walk a lot more that I'm used to since I came here.
My feet hurt.
I can feel the pain of my sedentary lifestyle.
Takeaki: "Hey, Yuuji!"
Uncle appeared.
Yuuji: "What?"
Takeaki: "Here's a package from Keijirou for you. It just came."
Yuuji: "From Dad?"
He handed over a small package.
Takeaki: "What should we have for dinner tonight? Is there anything you want to eat?"
Yuuji: "Hmmm..."
Yuuji: "Something with fish in it."
Takeaki: "Hmm... How about sashimi, then?"
Yuuji: "Uncle..."
Takeaki: "Hmmm?"
Yuuji: "Please take good care of me."
I bowed.
Takeaki: "Hahaha! Don't worry about a thing!"
Whack!!
Aaargh! My back!
Takeaki: "Why don't you relax until dinner is ready? I'll call you."
The floor creaked under Uncle's weight as he walked away.
He's an... interesting person.
Yuuji: "Well, now..."
A package from Dad...
I bet I know what's inside.
It's probably macadamia nuts or coconut chocolates.
I ripped off the paper and opened the box.
Yuuji: "Huh?"
A video tape?
All that was in the box was a single video tape.
There wasn't a letter or any macadamia nuts or anything.
The label on the tape merely said "From Dad."
He probably wants me to play it.
Yuuji: "What the hell is he thinking, anyway?"
I put the tape into my VCR.
I pressed the play button.
Frrrssshhh...
Keijiro: "Ahhh, ahhh. Testing, testing."
Keijiro: "Is this thing even recording?"
Keijiro: "Oh, I forgot to turn on the display."
There was a clicking sound, and the screen suddenly changed.
It showed a beautiful beach.
Keijiro: "Bwahahaha! Hey, Son! It's been a while!"
Yuuji: .........
I felt dizzy.
Keijiro: "I'm recording this video from my new workplace, Hawaii!"
Keijiro: "Just take a look at this beautiful Waikiki beach!"
My finger drew closer to the stop button.
Keijiro: "Hey! Knock it off! Don't stop the tape!"
Keijiro: "Just shut up and watch until the end."
Yuuji: "Dad, you're a moron."
Keijiro: "So, is everything going all right over there?"
Keijiro: "Your old dad is always worried about how you're doing."
Keijiro: "HEY! TROPICAL HAWAIIAN PINEAPPOH MIX, PREASE! JAPANESE YEN OH-KAY?"
Yuuji: "........."
Keijiro: "Slurp..."
I want to disown him.
Keijiro: "I imagine you're suffering through many hardships in your cold, dark, snowy craphole of a town right now."
Keijiro: "But I know you'll live a wonderful life because of it!"
Keijiro: "It was so hard for me to leave you behind and transfer here. Please understand this."
LIKE HELL I WILL!!
Keijiro: "No matter how much I fool around with big-breasted blond-haired beautiful girls here, I've always got you in the back of my mind."
Keijiro: "Anyway, some big beefy American bodybuilder picked up your mom a while ago, and I don't know where she is right now."
Yuuji: .........
Please, someone... Erase all traces of these two parents from my DNA...
Keijiro: "I'm running out of tape, so I'll keep this short."
Keijiro: "My time here has been extended to three years. I won't return to Japan before then!"
Huh?
Yuuji: "Hey, wait!! You said it was just going to be one year!!"
Keijiro: "It's no use yelling at this video!"
Yuuji: "Why, you..."
Keijiro: "Calm down, now."
Keijiro: "You'll have to live your own life from now on."
Keijiro: "Your mother and I will be watching you from here, in the land of eternal summer!"
Keijiro: "We're looking forward to watching you struggle!"
My mind went totally blank.
I thought I would be able to return to Tokyo after one year.
All my expectations crumbled to dust.
I'm going to be stuck in this frozen hellhole until I'm ready for college.
This is pretty heavy stuff...
Keijiro: "Oh, I almost forgot. One more thing..."
Yuuji: "What!?"
Keijiro: "This tape will self-destruct."
FROOOOSH!!
Yuuji: "Cough, cough!!"
Smoke billowed out of the VCR.
Dad, you asshole!
Rattle rattle...
I quickly opened the window.
But the smoke didn't go out!
That's right! They have double windows here!
Rattle rattle!
Finally, the smoke began to dissipate outside.
My VCR was totally destroyed.
Yuuji: "........."
I was in a stupor.
My forehead twitched slightly.
"You'll have to live your own life from now on."
In other words, he doesn't want to have any responsibility for me.
That bastard...
Saki: "Whoa! What's going on in here!? Cough, cough..."
Takeaki: "Hey! You shouldn't light fireworks indoors!"
Saki and Uncle came running into my room.
Amidst the ruckus...
...my life in this noisy, exasperating snowy country had truly begun.
