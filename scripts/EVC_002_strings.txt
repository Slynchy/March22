???: "Yuuji! It's morning!"
Mom?
???: "If you don't wake up soon, you won't have time for breakfast!"
Breakfast?
I'll pass on that today.
???: "Come on, wake up!"
Leave me alone!
It's freezing in here!
I'm staying home from school today.
I've made up my mind!
???: "If you don't get your act together and wake up..."
What a pest...
Saki: "This is what you get!!"
THUD!!

Yuuji: "Oof!!"
Pain unlike anything I'd ever felt before raced through my abdomen.
Saki: "Are you awake?"
Yuuji: "What do you mean, 'are you awake!?'"
I put on my uniform and went to the living room.
Yuuji: "That really hurt, you know! Are you trying to kill me?"
Saki: "Oh, that's your new uniform!"
Yuuji: "Listen to what I'm saying!"
Saki: "It's your own fault for not waking up!"
Yuuji: "Don't you think you overdid it a little for me not waking up?"
Yuuji: "You know, what you did to me there is called an 'elbow drop.' It really hurts!!"
Saki: "I know that. It's one of my special attacks."
Special attacks?
Yuuji: "So you're going to use a different attack to wake me up every morning?"
Saki: "That's all up to you, Yuuji."
There's something seriously wrong with this picture...
Yuuji: "Huh? Hey, where's Uncle?"
Saki: "Oh, he went to work."
Went to work? Oh, that's right. He cuts the fish at the town supermarket.
Yuuji: "I see. He sure goes to work early."
Saki: "That's right."
Even though she's my cousin, she's a girl my own age.
She's also pretty cute, as long as she keeps her mouth shut.
It makes me feel kind of nervous having breakfast with her.
Saki: "What are you looking at?"
Yuuji: "I'm not looking at anything!"
Saki: "Ah ha!"
Yuuji: "W-what?"
Saki: "You're thinking dirty thoughts about your adorable cousin Saki, aren't you?"
Yuuji: "No way!"
Saki: "You don't need to be shy about it!"
Saki: "It's perfectly normal for you to go head over heels when you see me in my uniform, Yuuji."
Yuuji: "Shut up, titless."
Saki: "WHAT DID YOU SAY!?"
It's very easy to make Saki angry.
Saki: "Uh oh! If we don't get going, we'll miss the train!"
Yuuji: "Why don't you notice these things sooner!?"
I quickly stuffed my breakfast into my mouth.
Saki: "Yuuji..."
Yuuji: "Mmmph?"
Saki: "That uniform looks good on you!"
I blushed a little.
???: "Oh! Your uniform came, huh?"
Yuuji: "Sumiyoshi?"
A really shallow-looking guy suddenly appeared.
Sumiyoshi: "So, I guess you're now officially a member of the Sakuragaoka Mates, Yuuji!"
I'm not in any mood for his crap today.
This guy's name is Sumiyoshi Itou.
He's a moron.
That is all.
Oh wait, I just thought of something else.
He's also a pervert.
That's just about all there is to know about him.
He's Saki's classmate, and he's been a clingy bastard since the day I transfered here.
Misaki: "Good morning, Saki!"
Saki: "Morning, Misaki!"
This cheerful girl is Misaki Souya.
She's cheeful and honest.
She's the total opposite of Saki, but for some reason they get along well.
She's also our teacher Miss Misato's younger sister.
Her puzzle is missing a few pieces as well.
Misaki: "G... good morning, Yuuji."
Whenever our eyes meet, she always turns red.
Just recently she's finally become able to speak normally with me.
Yuuji: "Good morning."
Misaki: "I see your uniform came."
Yuuji: "Yeah, what do you think? Does it suit me?"
Misaki: "........." (Blush)
Why are you blushing?
Saki: "I see Yuuji is looking at Misaki with lusty eyes again."
Yuuji: "Don't say stuff like that! You'll make me look bad!"
Sumiyoshi: "Yuuji, sensors indicate great potential perversion inside your body."
Yuuji: "No way."
Sumiyoshi: "Come on, man! You're my bestest buddy! My closest companion! We're a perfect match!"
I don't want to match you in any way.
Kozue: "Good morning, Misaki!"
Misaki: "Good morning, Kozue!"
The girl who suddenly ran up beside Misaki was...
Kozue Hiyama.
She has long black hair and deep, dark eyes.
Kozue: "Oh, Misaki! I was in hell for several hours while we were separated during the night!"
She seems to have some lesbian tendencies.
She's also the type of girl who's cute as long as her mouth is shut.
I wonder why all of Saki's friends are so weird, anyway...
Kozue: "Oh, Tachibana. Good morning."
She just noticed me standing here now.
Yuuji: "Morning."
Kozue: "Your uniform looks good on you!"
Yuuji: "Thanks."
Kozue: "By the way..."
Kozue: "What do you think of Misaki?"
She began questioning me.
Yuuji: "What are you talking about all of a sudden?"
Kozue: "Never mind that, just answer me!"
Yuuji: "Hmm, let's see..."
Yuuji: "She's a good girl."
Kozue: "Anything else?"
Yuuji: "Well, hmm... She's cute."
Kozue: "Oh, you think so too?"
Yuuji: "What's your problem?"
Kozue: "Tachibana, Misaki comes with my highest recommendations."
Saying that, she quickly turned and sped off towards Misaki.
What was that all about, anyway?
Sumiyoshi: "It's been a week since you transfered here, Yuuji."
Sumiyoshi: "I think you've really started to fit in well in our little group."
Yuuji: "Why are you acting so formal?"
Sumiyoshi: "I think the time has come."
Yuuji: "The time?"
Saki: "I agree. Shall we do it?"
Even Saki began talking a bunch of nonsense.
Misaki: "Yes, let's do it!"
Kozue: "If Misaki says so, then I agree as well."
Yuuji: "Just what are you all talking about?"
Saki: "Of course, we're talking about..."
Sumiyoshi: "Your welcoming party, Yuuji!"
My... welcoming party?
Sumiyoshi: "We'll have it at the usual place."
Misaki: "Got it. We'll meet at Itou's Place."
Yuuji: "Itou's Place? What's that?"
Sumiyoshi: "Yuuji, just say my full name."
Full name?
Yuuji: "Sumiyoshi Itou... Oh!"
Sumiyoshi: "That's right. My house."
Saki: "Sumi's house is an okonomiyaki shop."
Wow, I didn't know that.
An okonomiyaki shop...
Sumiyoshi: "Well, it's settled. Today after class, we'll have Yuuji Tachibana's welcoming party at Itou's Place."
Sumiyoshi: "We welcome your participation!"
Sounds like a television announcement.
Misato: "Oh, yes! I'll come too!"
She suddenly appeared from beneath my desk.
Yuuji: "Miss Misato! When did you...!?"
Misato: "That's a secret!"
Sumiyoshi: "All right! Since Miss Misato is coming, everything's on me!"
Saki: "Oh! Sumi, you're so manly!
Misato: "Let's all make Tachibana feel really special!"
Everyone: "Yeah!!"
Everyone is working together to throw a welcoming party just for me.
I'm touched...
Saki: "Oh? Yuuji, is that a tear I see in your eye?"
Yuuji: "No way!"
Saki: "Look, you're getting bashful again! You're so cute."
Saki could see right through me.
After class, Saki and I stood in front of the seniors' classroom.
Yuuji: "Hey, what are we doing here?"
Saki: "Never you mind about that!"
Saki seemed to be searching for someone...
Saki: "Oh! There she is! Rei!"
She called out with a loud voice.
A tall girl turned to face her.
Saki: "Hey, Rei! Over here! Over here!"
Is that girl a senior?
Saki, you should be more respectful!
Rei: "You called, Saki?"
This girl's name is Rei.
She's tall and slender.
She's got curves in all of the right places.
You could almost mistake her for a fashion model.
Her appearance is very neat and orderly.
Her hair is cut short, and she wears serious-looking glasses.
Saki: "Remember what I was telling you about before? This is my cousin Yuuji."
Rei: "Oh."
Rei: "Wait, are you Keijirou's son?"
Yuuji: "You know my father?"
Rei: "Yeah. My father's been friends with yours for a long time now."
Saki: "Rei is the daughter of the high priest at Yukito shrine!"
Yuuji: "Shrine?"
Saki: "Yukito shrine. Remember, where Auntie got married?"
Oh...
The shrine on top of the hill...
Saki: "You forgetful airhead."
Yuuji: "Shut up!"
It just slipped my mind for a moment.
Saki: "Anyway, we're having a welcoming party for Yuuji. Will you come?"
Rei: "Yeah, I'll come!"
Yuuji: "Well then, I'm very much looking forward to meeting you, er, uh..."
Rei: "Call me Rei. Also, you don't need to be so formal. It'll make your shoulders stiff."
Yuuji: "Okay. Rei it is, then."
Rei: "That's fine."
She smirked and walked away.
Saki: "What do you think? She's really beautiful, isn't she?"
Saki: "Rei also has the highest grades in her class."
Yuuji: "Whoa. Is she an honor student?"
Saki: "Well, maybe not quite. You'll understand when you get to know her."
What's that supposed to mean?
Sumiyoshi: "All right! Everyone eat up!"
Saki: "You don't need to tell me twice!"
Misaki: "This looks really good!"
Misato: "It's delicious!"
Kozue: "Ahh, the two of you are making such lovely faces."
Hiyama started taking lots of photos.
I guess she does that wherever she goes.
Sumiyoshi: "Come on, Rei! Try some of this!"
Rei: "How kind of you!"
He filled Rei's glass with a transparent liquid from a bottle.
Yuuji: "Hey, is that...?"
Rei: "What's wrong? You can't handle liquor?"
Yuuji: "No, that's not it..."
Sumiyoshi: "Hey, everyone else drink up too!"
He filled up our glasses, one after another.
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "So, this boy is Keijirou's son?"
Sumiyoshi: "Mom! Don't jump out so suddenly like that!"
Apparently that was Sumiyoshi's mother.
I see. There's a great family resemblance.
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "I heard he was Keijirou's son, so I came to see him for myself."
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "Oh, he looks and sounds just like his father!"
Just like my father... That is NOT something I wanted to hear.
Misaki: "Do you know him?"
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "Know him? There isn't anyone in these parts who hasn't heard of the infamous Tachibana Brothers."
Are our fathers really that infamous?
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "He was a no-good spoiled brat who kept flipping up my skirt..."
Sumiyoshi: "Ugh!! Mom, he flipped up your skirt!? Gross!!"
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "What's your problem? I was beautiful and famous in those days!"
Sumiyoshi: "No way! Get out of here, Mom!"
Sumiyoshi's Mother: "All right, all right. Everyone, eat as much as you like."
She retreated back to the kitchen.
She seemed to be a very nice, kind woman.
However, I'm not happy to find out how much of an impact Dad had around this area.
The day continued.
I felt myself becomimg very fond of this town.
Rei: "By the way, Tachibana."
Yuuji: "Yes?"
Rei: "Have you joined any clubs yet?"
Yuuji: "No, not yet."
Rei: "Well, do you have any plans?"
Yuuji: "I haven't given it much thought."
Rei: "I see."
Rei: "Then why don't you join the Environmental Protection Committee?"
Yuuji: "Environmental Protection Committee?"
Rei: "We clean and maintain the natural environment and facilities inside and outside of the school."
Rei: "It's especially important because we've got the Snow Sakura in this town."
Yuuji: "Huh?"
Snow Sakura?
I've heard that name somewhere before.
Snow Sakura... Snow Sakura...
I can't remember...
Rei: "What's wrong?"
Yuuji: "Nothing, I was just thinking..."
Rei: "Oh."
Rei: "The Snow Sakura is the symbol of this town."
Rei: "It's a cherry tree that blooms in the winter. That's why it's called the Snow Sakura.
Rei: "The Yukito shrine believes that it's a sacred tree."
Yuuji: "Oh..."
It seems to be pretty important.
Misato: "Come on, Tachibana! Join the Environmental Protection Committee!"
Yuuji: "Whoa!"
Miss Misato suddenly appeared between us.
Misato: "Join it!"
Is that an order!?
Rei: "Oh yeah, Miss Misato is our advisor."
Misato: "You're not used to this school yet, Tachibana, so you need the support of someone like Kisaragi!"
Misato: "So, with that, it's been decided that you'll join!"
That was quick!
What about my opinion!?
Misaki: "Oh, big sister, you've had too much to drink!"
Rei: "Misaki and Hiyama are members of the committee as well."
Rei: "You're lucky to be surrounded by such cute girls."
Rei: "You're lucky to be surrounded by such cute girls."
Hmm... Well, the three girls in the committee are cute, and Miss Misato is beautiful as well.
As I thought silently to myself...
Kozue: "........."
I made eye contact with Hiyama.
Hmm... So I'm a member of the committee now?
I don't think I like the way this is going...
.........
But it might be kind of fun.
They're a little crazy, but they seem to be decent people.
It should be fun being around them every day.
Sumiyoshi: "Number one, Sumiyoshi Itou reporting! I shall now lift this bottle with one of my nipple hairs!"
Saki: "Don't be gross!"
WHACK!
Sumiyoshi: "Urgh!"
Saki's mighty forearm smash sent Sumiyoshi tumbling to the ground.
I was on my way back from Itou's Place.
Saki, Rei and I walked side by side down the snowy road.
Saki: "That was fun, wasn't it?"
Yuuji: "Yeah."
Rei: "I'm sure things will become even more fun."
Yuuji: "Why do you say that?"
Rei: "Just a hunch."
Rei: "But my hunches are almost always right."
Yuuji: I began to feel the same way.
The chilly air felt good.
Rei: "Well, here's my stop."
Yuuji: "Good night, Rei."
Saki: "Good night. See you tomorrow!"
Rei: "Yep, tomorrow!"
We watched Rei walk away.
Saki: "Today was a busy day. It's been a long time since we partied like that."
Yuuji: "Yeah."
Saki: "Everything seems to be a lot busier since you came here, Yuuji."
Yuuji: "That's just your imagination."
Yuuji: "It just seems that way because there's more people around now."
I started to blush a bit.
Saki: "Yeah, maybe."
Saki grinned.
Takeaki: "Yuuji, how was school today?"
Uncle emerged from the bath.
Yuuji: "It was a lot of fun."
Takeaki: "That's good."
Yuuji: "I heard a lot about you and Dad, too."
Takeaki: "Oh? From who?"
Yuuji: "From Sumiyoshi's mom."
Takeaki: "Ah yes, that would be Chikako."
Takeaki: "What did she say?"
Yuuji: "She said you were nothing but a bunch of good-for-nothing brats."
Takeaki: "Hahaha! She's right, you know!"
He seemed to be proud of the fact.
Takeaki: "So, what do you think? This is an interesting town, isn't it?"
Yuuji: "Hmm... I guess it's all right."
Takeaki: "It's all right?"
Yuuji: "Yeah, it's all right!"
Uncle and I looked at each other and laughed.
