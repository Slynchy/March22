Girl: "Once a year, its flowers bloom in the chill of winter."

Even though it's a cherry tree?
Girl: "Yes, even though it's a cherry tree."
Cherry trees only bloom in the spring, you know.
Girl: "Normal cherry trees, yes. But this one blooms in the winter, so it's called the Snow Sakura."
That sounds like the name of some kind of cheap liquor.
Girl: "No way! You lack romanticism."
But there's no way such a cherry tree could exist.
Girl: "It does so exist! I saw it with my own eyes!"
Really?
Girl: "I'll show you! Over here!"

The story began about a week ago...
A young man, namely me, was on his way home from school.
When I opened the door, I was in for a shock.
First of all, the furniture was gone.
The house was totally empty.
In addition, my mother and father were nowhere to be seen.
All that remained in the house was a note lying on the floor.
Naturally, in my confusion I read the note.
It said...
Keijiro: "To my stupid son..."
Keijiro: "I know this is sudden, but my business transfered me overseas."
Keijiro: "I'm going to Hawaii. We'll be here for a full year. Your mother is very happy."
Keijiro: "We were going to bring you with us, but you've been kind of a wiseass lately, so we decided to leave you behind."
