The next morning, I recall what a perfect night last night was. So much so that I can't stop thinking about it.…

It's probably not the most appropriate time to reminisce, since I have a test first period.

Ah, it's so unfair. How can they do this? They hold a festival that is the culmination of what has to be at least a few weeks' worth of work on a Sunday, and then follow up with exams starting the very next morning?

It's got to be some kind of sick joke.

I'm not too worried about it, but I wonder if they really couldn't have held off on this for at least another week.

Well, at least the weather this morning is nice enough that I can study outside before class.

It's a lot more refreshing out here than it would be in the classroom. Not to mention with how quiet it is, I'm starting to think that everyone else will be sleeping in pretty late today.

I put down the notes I'm reviewing for a second and stare out at the school grounds, still littered with festival stalls.

Looking at them now in the daytime, without paper lanterns or crowds of people to draw my attention away from them, I notice something peculiar.

A lot of the stalls that Shizune, Misha, and I visited last night also happen to be ones that we worked on.

…

That's cute. Did Shizune come up with this? It had to be intentional, especially knowing her. Did she hope that I would catch on and see the fruit of our labors?

I hear footsteps crunching the grass behind me and turn around. I feel slightly paranoid, but all I find is Shizune standing there with an innocuous look on her face.

Shizune: "…"

Hisao: "Good morning."
