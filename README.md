# March22 Interactive Novel engine
A C++ engine using SDL2 for making interactive narrative/novels in an easy-to-use language.

# How to build
Embed Lua in the correct folder, link with SDL2 (Mixer, TTF and image libraries) and compile the code with VS2015 (recommended; others might work). This project uses [NFont](https://github.com/grimfang4/nfont) and [SDL_FontCache](https://github.com/grimfang4/SDL_FontCache).

# How to use
A template project will be uploaded at some point that will already be compiled and working, ready for new images/scripts.

# Documentation
Be sure to look at [m22_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md](https://github.com/Slynchy/March22/blob/master/m22_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md "m22_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md") to know how M22 script works.

The documentation available for the old, Visual Novel version of the engine is here: http://slynch.ovh/Public/M22
