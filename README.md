# March22
A C++ engine using SDL2 for making/porting classic VNs to modern platforms.

# How to build
Include the headers with the source files, compile the code with whatever compiler you like, and ensure the compiler is linked with SDL2 (with Mixer, TTF and image libraries). If anyone manages to get it compiling on platforms other than Windows, give me a shout!
