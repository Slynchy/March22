# Snow-Sakura-CPP
A port of the visual novel Snow Sakura to C++, as a demo to the March22 engine.

# How to build
Compile the code with whatever compiler you like, linked with SDL2 (with Mixer, TTF and image libraries). If anyone manages to get it compiling on platforms other than Windows, give me a shout!
