# March22
A C++ engine using SDL2 for making/porting classic VNs to modern platforms. 

Progress of Snow Sakura port: 2 scripts of ~126
(if you would like to help, it's not difficult; just tedious! Simply contact me!)

# How to build
Compile the code with whatever compiler you like, linked with SDL2 (with Mixer, TTF and image libraries) and embed Lua in the folder under "include". If anyone manages to get it compiling on platforms other than Windows, give me a shout!
