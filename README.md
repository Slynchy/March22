# March22
A C++ engine using SDL2 for making/porting classic VNs to modern platforms.

# How to build
Compile the code with whatever compiler you like, linked with SDL2 (with Mixer, TTF and image libraries). If anyone manages to get it compiling on platforms other than Windows, give me a shout!

# Documentation
See documentation here: http://slynch.ovh/Public/M22

Be sure to look at [m22_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md](https://github.com/Slynchy/March22/blob/master/m22_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md "m22_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md") to know how M22 script works.
